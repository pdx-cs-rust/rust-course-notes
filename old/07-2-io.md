## I/O

* Philosophy: simple and complete, with good translation
  to host environment

* No big surprises

* We will deal with `async` I/O later

## Basic Reading and Writing

* There's `Read`, `BufRead` and `Write` traits

* These provide `read()` and `write()` methods
  very similar to UNIX, with the dumb interface

* Wrapper methods for exact-length reads and writes

        let mut bytes = [0u8;1024];
        f.read_exact(&mut bytes).unwrap();
        g.write_all(&bytes).unwrap();

## Buffered Reading and Writing

* There's also `BufReader` and `BufWriter` structs

* These can be used to wrap a `Read` or `Write`
  unbuffered type to get a buffered type.

## Readers and Writers

* Any sensible thing, including `String`s and `Vec`s, is
  `Read` / `Write`
  
* The `Cursor` struct is used for simulating a seekable thing

* Can implement the `Read` and `Write` traits for your own
  structs

## Rust Stdio

* `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` are treated as *functions
  returning* readers / writers, because locking across
  threads

* Note that the types of `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` are different

## Stdio notes

* *Lock* `stdin` to get a `BufRead` struct. `stdout` is already
  auto-buffered. `stderr` should rarely be buffered

* The `flush` situation is non-optimal

* Stdio performance is absolute garbage, so don't use it if
  you're in any kind of hurry
  (<http://github.com/BartMassey/fasthello>).

* Can instead "roll-your-own" using `unsafe` FFI
  (<http://github.com/BartMassey/nonstdio>)

* `examples/stdio.rs`

## File I/O and Paths

* `Path` / `PathBuf` deal with filenames / pathnames

    * `PathBuf` is just a wrapper on `OsString`, which means it
      can contain any byte sequence: be careful

* `OsString` / `OsStr` sometimes to deal with file contents

## Network I/O

* General networking (as opposed to Rust interface) out of
  scope for this course

* TCP provides a stream abstraction that works well with
  Rust I/O
