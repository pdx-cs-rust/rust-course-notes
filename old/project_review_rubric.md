You have been asked to review a project by another student
or group of students or by me. This should not take long. (I
expect it will take less than an hour.)

You *must* be polite and positive in your reviews. Criticism
is *not* useful. Ways the project can be improved are
useful. I take this very seriously. Make every comment in a
good way: offer ways to make the project better. If you
can't, don't make the comment at all. When things are good,
say so: don't just be quiet.

These projects are not done yet. That is OK: I am asking you
to look at the code *as is* at this point in the project.

Here's what I want you to look for:

## Who and What

* Is the project name clear?

* Are the authors identified by name?

* Is there some way to contact the authors?

* Is there an easy-to-find copyright notice for the project?

* Is there an easy-to-find and clear license for the project?

* Can you tell what the project is trying to do?

## Repo

* Does the repo have a solid top-level README?

* Are there binary files in the repo? (This is almost always
  a mistake.)

* Are there passwords or other secrets in the repo?

* Does the issue tracker for the repo have issues filed in
  it? (It is OK not to have any, but you should read them if they are there.)

* Is the repo missing useful documentation?

## Structure

* Is the directory structure of the project clear and usable?

* Does the project build using Cargo? Is the `Cargo.toml`
  OK?

* Can you build the project? If not, do you know how you
  would build it when it is complete?

* Can you run the project? If not, do you know how you would
  run it when it is complete?

## Code Quality

* Is the code format like you would expect: normal Rust
  format? Would `rustfmt` edit the code a lot?

* Is the crate / module layout clear and usable?

* Pick a few small sections of code.

    * Can you read the code easily? Can you tell what it is
      trying to do?

    * Are there good comments in the code?

    * Has Rustdoc been used to document the code? Are there
      tests or doctests in the code?

* Is some of this code not written by the students? If so,
  does it say clearly where it came from; is this code that
  the students are allowed to use by license?

## Completion

* How close is this code to being done? Can it be finished
  in the time remaining?

* If the code looks too far from done, what could be done
  to make the project simpler so that it could finish?

## Other Thoughts

* What is best about this project? What has been done well?

* What else could be done to improve the project? Focus on
  things with small effort that would for sure make it
  better.
