## Moving Forward With Rust

* You have hopefully developed your basic Rust skills

* You have surveyed a whole bunch of Rust topics

* Now what, and why?

## Developing Rust Skills

* Keep solving problems

    * Toy problems — problem sets, etc

    * Real problems — crate scale solutions

* Contribute to Rust work

    * Work on core Rust issues, etc. Cargo and crates.io
      especially need love right now

    * Contribute to key crates, and to crates that you value

## Learn More Rust

* *Rust For Rustaceans* (*Intermediate Rust*) by Jon
  "JonHoo" Gjengset (No Starch Press)

* Check out the [Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/)
  (probably shouldn't say that out loud)

* Really dive into some advanced topic

    * Web, WASM (Web Assembly)
    * async/await
    * compiler / tools stuff
    * embedded

## Look For A Job

* Right now, FAANG companies and many others are eagerly
  hiring Rust devs

* Beware "crypto" / blockchain stuff

## Support The Community

* Help with documentation, outreach, mentoring

* Write and speak publicly

## Have Fun

This is the most important
