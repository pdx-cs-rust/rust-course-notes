## Origins

* Usual story: one genius — Graydon Hoare — and a few
  friends / acquaintances

* At Mozilla Corp, which matters in community. Aimed at
  Firefox / C++

* Built on a bunch of esoteric languages — Standard ML,
  Cyclone, etc — which matters in who is attracted

## Timeline

* 2010: Project kicks off, grows steadily

* 2015: Rust 1.0

* Somewhere in there: Graydon leaves

* 2020: Mozilla lays off 250 / 1000 employees including
  many Rust folks

* 2021: Rust Foundation formed

## Organization

* Rust Project vs Rust Foundation

* Rust Project is technical, has Teams: quite a bit of autonomy

* Rust Foundation is explicitly not technical, but funding
  and support

## Project Governance

* "Cabal"-style group of mutually-selected people

* Occasional controversy about membership and organization

* Relationship with Code of Conduct etc complicated

* Moderation Team enforces Code of Conduct

## Project Values

* Technical values: Performance, Reliability, Productivity

* Community values (probably): Civility, Learning, Cooperation

## Community Hub

* https://www.rust-lang.org/community

* Code of Conduct: https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct

## Pressures On The Community

* Influx of folks from other communities with other values 

    * Huge: C++
    * Huge: Haskell
    * Javascript, Java, Python, …

* Push toward money / commerce: "crypto", jobs concerns, licensing, …

* Problems of rapid growth (especially international)

## You'll Hear About This Somewhere Anyway (YHATSA): ActixWeb

* Author of ActixWeb "Actor"-style Rust web framework pushes it
  to be the "fastest" of any on a popular web benchmark

* ActixWeb becomes very widely used

* Over time, folks start to look closely at the
  code. Turns out it's full of "bad" `unsafe`

* Community takes author to task pretty harshly, dives in,
  and fixes the "bad" `unsafe`

* Over another year or two, author puts more in

* Community takes author to task even more harshly

* Author quits project and quits Rust, leaves ActixWeb in
  community hands

* Project still very widely used

## YHATSA: Mod Team Resignation

* Turnover in the Rust Project Teams

* Person not generally trusted by the community ends up in a
  position of authority and responsibility

* There are unknown incidents reputedly involving person
  (yay gossip)

* Mod Team vs Core Team: how should this be handled?

* Mod Team resigns out of feeling of inability to do the job

* This has now simmered down: largely handled internally

## I *Like* This Community

* Overwhelmingly friendly and encouraging

* Most everyone is easy to talk to

* General feeling of openness and collaboration

* Explicit recognition of difficulties and limits

## Community Is Hard

* Lots of things to work on still

    * Better governance structures

    * Dealing with social issues

    * Scaling

* Learn the community, then…

* Jump in and help!
