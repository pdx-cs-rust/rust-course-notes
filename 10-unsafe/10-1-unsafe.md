## How To Be unsafe

* In front of a function

        // must call from an unsafe place
        unsafe fn foo() {
            // unsafe stuff here
        }

* In front of a block

        unsafe {
            // unsafe stuff here
        }

## The unsafe Keyword

* Turns off *some* of the compiler checks when
  applied to a block or function
  
    * Can call unsafe functions

    * Can dereference raw pointers

    * Can mutate global variables

    * Can use `extern` Foreign-Function Interface (FFI)
  
* That is *all* it gives you

## Consequence Of unsafe Abuse

* Undefined Behavior (UB) when a program

    * Reads uninitialized memory

    * Creates invalid primitive values

        1. Invalid (including null) references or Boxes
        2. `bool` values that are not either 0 or 1
        3. `enum` values with bogus discriminants
        4. `char` values that are not Unicode code points
        5. `str` values that are not UTF-8

    * Violates the lifetime or sharing rules with references

    * Dereferences a bogus pointer â€” points somewhere
      invalid or *misaligned*

    * Has a data race

    * Unwinds across FFI calls (obscure)

    * Violates standard library (or other) function
      contracts
  
* UB may do nothing, may cause trouble, or may only cause
  trouble when the optimizer gets clever
  
## Sidebar: Alignment

* What is pointer alignment? Well on most architectures, a
  pointer to an object bigger than a byte can't just point
  at any byte as its starting address

* Alignment rules vary per architecture etc, but on most
  machines

  * A `u16` pointer must point at an even address
  * A `u32` pointer must point at an address that is a
    multiple of 4
  * A `u64` pointer must point at an address that is a
    multiple of 8
  * etc

* In most languages, this means that a struct or enum
  pointer must point at an address with some minimal
  alignment, usually the word size of the machine

* On a 64-bit machine, struct and enums will typically be
  required to have 8-byte alignment

* Why?

  * Some architectures don't even have a hardware
    instruction to access a misaligned word. So the compiler
    would have to do two aligned accesses plus some shifting
    and masking. The aligned accesses may not even be
    possible at the beginning or end of memory region

  * Architectures that allow unaligned access typically
    penalize performance *heavily* (e.g. Intel)

## Unsafe "Contracts"

* Code should be written so that *when properly used* UB
  cannot occur
  
* To inform the user of the code, a natural-language
  "contract" should be written specifying how an
  `unsafe` function can be safely called
  
* The contract should appear as a rustdoc comment before the
  function

* `unsafe` blocks inside a function must be used in such a
  way that no valid call to the function can cause UB

* e.g. [`from_utf8_unchecked()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/fn.from_utf8_unchecked.html)

## Unsafe Block "Contracts"

* Every `unsafe` block should have a comment above that
  describes

    * *Need* (why should this block be `unsafe`?)

    * *Safety* (why is this block not UB?)

## Raw Pointers

* Declared for some type `T` via `*const T` or `*mut T`

* Are essentially just C pointers

* Not `unsafe` to do anything *other than* dereference them

* Whole bunch of functions in `std::ptr` and `std::mem` for
  dealing with them
  
* `examples/nullptr.rs`

* You can drop memory out from under a raw pointer. Watch
  out for ownership problems
  
* Can cast back to a ref with `as`, but be careful: default
  lifetime is `'static`, while the referenced data probably
  isn't at all
