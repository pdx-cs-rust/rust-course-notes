## FFI (Foreign Function Interface)

* All `unsafe`

* Can declare external stuff with `extern`

* Watch out for "name mangling"

* A bunch of stuff in `std::os` for dealing with C types and
  values

    * Numeric types and sizes
  
    * Strings

## Import vs Export

* May want to call C/C++ from Rust

* May want to provide API from Rust for C/C++ to call

* Both are supported by similar interfaces

## More Detail

* `std::ffi::CString` is crucially important

* Getting structs to cross the boundary is hard:
  `#[repr(C)]` is a start

* Memory management is brutal: must not drop C stuff in Rust
  code, nor free Rust stuff in C code

* Neither Rust panics nor C++ exceptions may cross the
  FFI boundary

## Binding Generators

* Parse interface definitions for some language and generate
  low-level FFI

* `bindgen`: old-school tool for simple C FFI codegen. Use
  for existing C libraries

* `cxx`: new-school cool for fuller C++ compatibility. Use
  for new cross-platform C++ code. Uses an explicit description
  driven by a proc macro

* `autocxx`: `bindgen`-like automation, `cxx`-like
  compatibility

## Bindgen

* Walks C `.h` file at build time

* Generates low-level Rust FFI code

* Set up to generate at client build time via `build.rs`, or
  use `bindgen` tool

* Only supports very simple types

## CXX

* (A terrible name)

* Interface parser takes `.h` files

* Also, extensive Rust macros for the Rust side: provides
  higher-level interface

* Set up to generate at client build time via `build.rs`, or
  use `cxxbridge` tool

* <https://cxx.rs/tutorial.html>
